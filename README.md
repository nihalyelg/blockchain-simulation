# blockchain-simulation
A basic blockchain simulation that mimics the core features of a blockchain.

## Description
This project is a simple blockchain simulation built with Python. It demonstrates the key concepts of blockchain, including:
- Block creation
- Proof-of-Work (mining)
- Chain validation
- Simulating tampering and its detection

## Features
1. **Genesis Block**: Automatically creates the first block in the chain.
2. **Add Blocks**: Add blocks with transactions.
3. **Proof-of-Work**: Each block is mined with a specified difficulty level.
4. **Chain Validation**: Validates the integrity of the blockchain.
5. **Tampering Simulation**: Demonstrates the impact of tampering with the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses Python's standard library)
- Docker is required to containerize the application for consistent execution across different systems.


## Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nihalyelg/blockchain-simulation.git
cd blockchain-simulation
```
### 2. Run the Blockchain Simulation with Docker

You can run the blockchain simulation inside a Docker container
